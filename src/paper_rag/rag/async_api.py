"""Async-friendly entrypoints for the QA hot path.

The underlying retrieve / abstain / LLM call stack is synchronous (uses the
sync `openai` client + sync `qdrant_client.QdrantClient` + sync sqlite). A
full async rewrite would touch ~30 files; instead we offload the entire
sync call to a thread, which is exactly what `starlette.run_in_threadpool`
or `anyio.to_thread.run_sync` were designed for.

This module exposes:

    await answer_async(question, paper_ids=...)           # qa_agentic.answer
    async for ev in stream_answer_async(question, ...):   # qa_stream.stream_answer

so a FastAPI handler can `await answer_async(...)` and not block the event
loop. CPU-bound or IO-bound work happens on a worker thread, FastAPI keeps
serving other requests.

Why this is sufficient for the current deployment:
    - Single OpenAI client is shared (rag/llm.py P1) so HTTP connection
      reuse already kicks in.
    - Qdrant + SQLite are sub-millisecond local calls.
    - The dominant latency is the LLM round trip, which the OS schedules
      on the worker thread without holding the GIL.
