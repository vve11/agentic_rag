"""Abstain decision module — three-way evidence sufficiency check.

Goal
----
Bridge the gap exposed by the M6 33-question evaluation: when retrieval
correctly recalls 0 relevant papers (e.g. "Shanghai weather tomorrow" against
a NLP-paper corpus), the downstream LLM still happily cites 14 noisy chunks.
This module gives qa_agentic a first-class "abstain" decision **before** any
LLM call is made.

Decision protocol
-----------------
Given the final chunk list (already RRF-fused + reranked + truncated):

    no_chunks       — chunks == []
    no_evidence     — evidence_score < threshold_low      (LLM is SKIPPED)
    weak_evidence   — threshold_low <= score < threshold_high  (LLM is called
                      with an explicit "evidence may be insufficient" hint)
    confident       — score >= threshold_high             (normal flow)

`evidence_score` is the mean of the top-`min_chunks` scores after selecting
the highest-quality scoring signal available in the candidate dict (preference
order is configurable; default `score_rerank > score_dense > score`). RRF
scores are bounded ~`(0, 0.05]` so they get linearly normalized into a [0, 1]-ish
band before mean — this keeps the same threshold semantics regardless of
whether the reranker is enabled.

Industrial-grade properties
---------------------------
1. **Pure function** — `decide()` takes a list[dict] + thresholds, returns a
   typed dict. No I/O, no logging side-effects, easy to unit-test.
2. **Backward compatible** — when `enabled=False` (default until calibration),
   always returns `confident` so qa_agentic behaves exactly as before.
3. **Graceful fallback** — if score fields are missing or non-numeric, the
   decision falls back to `confident` rather than blocking the pipeline.
4. **Observable** — every decision returns the score, threshold, and the
   field it used; callers expose this in metrics + trace.
5. **Calibratable** — thresholds come from `cfg.rag.abstain` and are picked
   by `scripts/calibrate_abstain.py` from a real eval_runs/*.json + GT. No
   magic numbers in code.
