"""Section-completeness sanity checker.

Heuristic: a "complete" academic paper parse should contain at least one
section name matching each major area. We just look at the section names
(case-insensitive substring match) — chunk count would be too noisy.

Returns a string label suitable for `Paper.parsed_with` augmentation:
  - "complete": all 4 areas found
  - "partial": at least intro+method but missing experiments or conclusion
  - "minimal": only intro/abstract found
  - "broken": none of the canonical areas found

Used by ingest_pipeline to set `parsed_with={parser_name}+{quality}` so we
can later filter out broken parses without re-running everything.
